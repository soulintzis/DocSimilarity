C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming,
lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations.
By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and it has
therefore found lasting use in applications that were previously coded in assembly language. Such
applications include operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging
from supercomputers to embedded systems.
