C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup
as an extension of the C language, or "C with Classes". It has imperative, object-oriented and generic
programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost
always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free
Software Foundation, Microsoft, Intel, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.
