Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine
learning methods based on the layers used in artificial neural networks. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised
or unsupervised. Deep learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural
networks and convolutional neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition,
natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics,
drug design, medical image analysis, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results
comparable to and in some cases superior to human experts.
