In computing, JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open-standard file format that uses human-readable text to
transmit data objects consisting of attribute–value pairs and array data types (or any other serializable value).
It is a very common data format used for asynchronous browser–server communication, including as a replacement
for XML in some AJAX-style systems hello.
